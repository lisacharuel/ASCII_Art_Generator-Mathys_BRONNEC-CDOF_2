## **Description of the project**

The project aims to allow the user to enter a specific text and the app will print you back the ASCII art version of it.    :)

## **Prerequisites**

Before we dive into the coding part, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You should use Visual Studio to implement or contribute to the project.

## **Designing the User Interface**

For this ASCII art generator App, weâ€™ll be using the terminal directly. The interface is straitghforward, you just input your text, and it prints you the ascii art.
